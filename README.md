# LinklistExcercises

This is one of the many (in the future) project where I practice interview questions.  
Featured here are Linklist related problems I studied during my college days which I've long forgotten.

The target is the have the most optimal solution "I" can design and code in a typical interview duration of 45min to 1hr.
The context of an interview setting influence certain coding style.

- Generous use of local variables with longer names to "spell out" the algorithm that had been designed on paper or the white board.
This helps communicating the algorithm during discussion with the interviewer and debugging manually by eyes.

- ZERO effort in optimizing "lines of code," again for the same reason above.  I find trying to be clever by wrapping code inline can make bugs diffecult to find and makes it harder for the interviewer to follow.  This can be seen where objects are submitted as parameters or new pointers are used just to change the name of variables as the algorithm develops.
